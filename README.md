# GitHub Identity 101

This repo includes scripts related to git/github identity management. Instructions are provided in README files in each script's directory.

I have also published a [Dev.to blog post](https://dev.to/tinkermakar/how-to-use-github-trough-multiple-users-on-the-same-pc-4293) and a [Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlmXsTNzygU) on this topic.
